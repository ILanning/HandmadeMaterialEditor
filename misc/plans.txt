Memory Allocation:
	The memory which will not change depending on the model and images loaded will be allocated as a single chunk and handled in the way shown on the Handmade Hero stream.
	The memory required for the images and models will be allocated on a file-by-file basis, with each file being its own object/allocation.

	Arena Types:
		StackArena:
			-Allows additions of arbitrary size
			-Anything may be accessed, but only the last item may be deleted
		FixedSizeArena (needs a better name):
			-The size of the items within is set at initialization
			-Items may be deleted at will
			-Keeps a heap (data structure) of deleted entries which starts at the end of the Arena and grows inwards
		NewDeleteArena:
			-Just a wrapper for new and delete
		FillInArena (needs a better name):
			-Allows additions of arbitary size, as well as deletions from anywhere
			-Each entry has a leading int32 denoting the size
			-Keeps a list of deleted entries and their sizes
			-New additions search the deleted list first, looking for an open spot of sufficient size
			-If it finds a space of the right size or greater, it fills that spot in and subtracts the space it used from the size of the entry
			-Prone to fragmentation over time if some entries are long lived and others are not

			Replace this with LinkedBlockArena; contains a pointer to the next block instead of a size int, splits the first small-enough block it finds

Input:
	Actions:
		The purpose of the Actions system is to seperate the consumers of input from the actual keys/buttons being pressed.
		A user of the Actions system will call a function on the InputManager that takes an action (or an identifier for one) and optionally a player or numbered input device, and get back an independent value
			Basic return types (and example sources): 
				bool:    Key presses, key press combos
				real32:  Scroll wheel values, partial button depressions, key pairs
				Vector2  Mouse location, mouse movement, four key 2D directional controls, post-deadzone joystick output
				Vector3  Six key 3D directional controls
		Example call:  Vector2 cameraMovement = inputManager.ReadAction("SpinCamera", 1);
		Actions are likely stored by the InputManager in dictionaries, with one per return type
	InputManager:
		Tracking for what device an input came from, management of devices being added and removed
		Dealing with checking whether a certain action happened on any input device vs. a specific one, or only checking within a certain set that belong to a specific player/profile
		Maybe store inputs in two ways:  A simple array for each device with the current and last frame state of the inputs, 
		 and a linked list (or something) of every change in button state since startup/within a certain distance from present time.
		 This way, anything that needs a more detailed history would have a way to access it, but most button checks are still near instant.

	Cleanup Pass - Examine all uses of new, VirtualAlloc(), etc. and ensure that there aren't any memory leaks
	Cleanup Pass - Organize everything into sensible namespaces
	Cleanup Pass - Ensure Doxygen support
	Cleanup Pass - Ensure robust unit tests exist for anything that they'd be sensible for
	Cleanup Pass - Reexamine TODOs and CONSIDERs

	Write shaders for each of the material illumination models
	Apply material effects to the model as a preview

	Load a font using stb_truetype
	Render text to the screen
	Write TextPositionColor class
	Write a proper HandmadeString class
	Create a system to manage memory for strings automatically
	Cleanup Pass - Ensure Doxygen support
	Cleanup Pass - Ensure robust unit tests exist for anything that they'd be sensible for
	Cleanup Pass - Reexamine TODOs and CONSIDERs

	Generate and draw the graphic for a button
	Render text to a button sprite
	Support UI rendering in the render engine
	Make the button clickable

	Due to time constraints, build demo here with button to reload .mtl from file on the fly

	Make an editable text box
	Display the material data on the screen with sensible components editable
	Allow saving of the file
	Cleanup Pass - Ensure Doxygen support
	Cleanup Pass - Ensure robust unit tests exist for anything that they'd be sensible for
	Cleanup Pass - Reexamine TODOs and CONSIDERs

	Actions/Gestures - Update InputManager to manage a set of actions that may be associated with keys.  
			Functions like IsDown() will accept an action, see what key it's linked with, and return the status of that key.
	Actions/Gestures - Actions may contain many keys, any of which can be hit, or a set of keys that all must be hit, or both, or neither
	Actions/Gestures - Bound actions may be written to and read from a file

	Replace UI code and platform layer with a C#/WPF application, using the same handmade.dll for both

	Develop a UE4 plugin with the same functionality, and if possible/sensible also using the same handmade.dll 

Nice To Have/Future Goals:

	Add audio

	Editing hints - say when a value is invalid, nonstandard, etc.

	Use a true rendering engine (Such as Pango) and UTF-8 for all sensible strings

	Make MTL and OBJ loaders extensible from outside libraries
